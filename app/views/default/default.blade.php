	    Hello! I am a web developer, and this is a project I started last year in order to
	    evaluate a Javascript framework. I recently started it again from scratch, this time
	    to evaluate a PHP framework.
	    <br><br>
	    The app pulls Congressional voting data from GovTrack.us, and pushes it out via Twitter
	    accounts, one for each state. For example: 
	    <br>  
	    <a href="https://twitter.com/sdshouldknow" target="_blank">sdshouldknow - South Dakota</a>
	    <br>
	    <a href="https://twitter.com/mnshouldknow" target="_blank">msshouldknow - Minnesota</a>
	    <br><br>
	    Honestly, I have no idea yet what I am going to do with this. Everything here flows from Twitter,
	    and data is displayed just as it is retrieved.
