	    Hello! Welcome! This is a little project that I have been working on that caters to a weird desire to know how those in Congress are representing my interests.
	    <br><br>
	    It works like this: The app pulls Congressional voting data from GovTrack.us, and pushes it out via Twitter accounts, one for each state. For example: 
	    <br>  
	    <a href="https://twitter.com/sdshouldknow" target="_blank">sdshouldknow - South Dakota</a>
	    <br>
	    <a href="https://twitter.com/mnshouldknow" target="_blank">msshouldknow - Minnesota</a>
	    <br>
	    The status updates at Twitter include a link back to ushouldknow.us with some information about the vote, the result, and any other relevant bill info. As it progresses, I am hoping to include information from more resources. Data is displayed more or less as it is retrieved, and is emperical in nature. The same data is available from GovTrack.us.
	    <br><br>
	    I am open to new ideas. There is a contact link on the bottom right of the page. Use it if you feel inclined.
